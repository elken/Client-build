# Client-build

Quick & easy script to bootstrap a [Project Ascension](https://github.com/Proj-Ascension/Client) installation.

You can either run this script yourself, or you can download and run a pre-compiled dependency-free executable [here](https://github.com/elken/Client-build/releases/tag/v1.0).

To run yourself:

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/), ensuring that you check any box relating to adding it to PATH
2. Open a cmd window (`WinKey + r`, `cmd`) and type `pip install clint requests`
3. `cd` to the directory you saved the script to
4. `python build.py`
